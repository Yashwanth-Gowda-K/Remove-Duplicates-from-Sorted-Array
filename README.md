# Remove-Duplicates-from-Sorted-Array

This repository contains my Python solution to the classic LeetCode problem: **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**.
## üîç Problem Statement
Given a sorted array `nums`, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

### Example
Input:
```python
nums = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]

Used two-pointer technique (i and j)
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place modification)
